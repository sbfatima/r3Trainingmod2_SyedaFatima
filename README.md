grid_generator:
For this I used the base code and lines 20,21 to ask for n value. Next, drawgrid generated the grid by taking x and y  as the same so just i and the size in between formulates for the spacing. finally in the while loop which is the main algorithm to keep running the code, drawgrid func takes the width of screen as w, n (input) as rows and screen (defined in beginning) as area and it generated the grid as n is entered

maze_generator:
for this code, I watched videos online and tried my best. I struggled with connecting my grid code to this grid code. I understand what I did completely but did not have enough time to learn how to not hardcode it and use my grid generator. However, found it very interesting and will continue to improve and learn this task 2 after submitting. I included comments to show what I did and learned from youtube tutorial
